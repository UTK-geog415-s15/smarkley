Originally I'm from Marietta, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb located about 30 minutes northwest of downtown. 

I received my undergraduate degree at Georgia Southern University, where I graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts in geography and minors in GIS and economics.

Currently I am a first-year masters student in geography at the University of Tennessee. My thesis focuses on neighborhood change (ethnic/racial,economic,housing) in suburban Atlanta from the time of the housing boom to the post-crisis/recovery period. My future goals are to continue my education through the PhD level and work either in academia or with a research institute or agency.
